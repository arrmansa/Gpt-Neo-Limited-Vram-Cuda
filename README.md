# Gpt-Neo-Limited-Vram-Cuda
 A notebook that runs GPT-Neo with low vram (currently 8 gb, but could be made lower relatively easily) and cuda acceleration by loading it into gpu memory in smaller parts.
 This method may perhaps provide a much more significant acceleration if used with much larger models and higher vram gpus, making it possible to run large models (such as gpt-3)  on consumer hardware.
